#  Xcode IB Auto Layout ifs and buts

OK, so let me play along with the video tutorial
[14 Auto Layout Best Practices for Xcode 9 and iOS 11 (using Storyboards)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqO11vmzapg) by Paul Solt of supereasyapps, and the series [30 Auto Layout Best Practices](https://blog.supereasyapps.com/30-auto-layout-best-practices/#the-hidden-layout-error-panel) from the same bloke (guy, if you prefer).

From iPhone_Apps_101.zip I picked out `3.2 - Tip Calculator - Begin` project directory, seeing that the Main.storyboard looks about the same as that seen at the start of the video.

Add .gitignore, commit all the uncommitted assets and minor tweaks. It builds successfully.

In IB, add previews for several devices, from the tiny iPhone 4s to the huge iPad 12.9.


### Apple Xcode+IB peeves ###
- looks like there is no keyboard shortcut to the Preview tab in IB. It takes 3 clicks to get there, once you know where to click.
